# Classic Encryption Techniques

Welcome to the "Classic Encryption Techniques" repository! This repository contains Python code implementations for classic encryption techniques, specifically the Caesar cipher and the Playfair cipher.

## Ciphers Implemented

- **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- **Playfair Cipher**: A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters together using a 5x5 matrix.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**:
  - Encryption and decryption functions
  - Customizable shift value
- **Playfair Cipher**:
  - Encryption function only
  - Customizable key for the 5x5 matrix
